This week was a very productive week, the software is moving forward very fast, jack and nick have implemented the code for
the  camera to follow the line and open the gate, but we haven't yet got the code working for when the tape diverges.
We have implemented PD controller in our code to help with tracking. Finn is now helping Jack and Nick with finding the code
for better error checking and improving the PD design. 

As for the hardware and design, Krishna had an in depth parts list for what we need until 80%.
Cicero has been ticking away at learning the CAD software and is now in the initial planning phase of the final build.
They are now working on measuring the 80% part of the maze, and thinking about necessary hardware to complete it.
This is useful for the final design because size of the bot affects turning radius and ability to traverse the maze.
