Parts List Revision 1:

- Motors x2, Base motors, do not require an upgrade unless looking for speed however accuracy is the main point of focus
  at this time

- Battery Pack,6.6V, minimum of 5V required for basic operation of the pi therefore 6.6V is plenty 
  by taking to account the voltage required by the other components, Weight in 91 grams.
  
- Roller Wheel, minimises issues in turning, doesnt get caught on itself.

- Small wheels, small motor rotations shouldn't affect the overall tracking system as it would with larger wheels.
  Smaller wheels = more rotations complete a 360 degree turn, this means that the smaller wheels atribute to a more percise turn.
  
- Raspberry Pi with the custom Shield 

- Camera, Base camera works well, will not need to be upgraded unless software is having major issues reading the color
  seperation between the white line and the black background.
